# Oh My Zsh and Powerlevel10k Installer for Fedora

This script automates the installation and setup of Oh My Zsh, the Powerlevel10k theme, and popular plugins (zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting) on Fedora-based systems.

It is designed to be safe, user-friendly, and idempotent (it can be run multiple times without side effects).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic dependency installation**: Checks and installs zsh, git, and wget if missing
- **Oh My Zsh installation**: Sets up the popular framework for managing Zsh configuration
- **Powerlevel10k integration**: Installs and activates a fast, flexible terminal theme
- **Essential plugins included**:
  - `zsh-autosuggestions`: Suggests commands as you type
  - `zsh-syntax-highlighting`: Provides syntax highlighting
- **Safety first**: Automatically backs up your `.zshrc` before modifications
- **User confirmation**: Prompts before installing packages or changing shells
- **Idempotent operation**: Won't reinstall existing components
- **Color-coded output**: Easy-to-follow installation process
